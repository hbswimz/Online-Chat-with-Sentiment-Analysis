# Online-Chat-with-Sentiment-Analysis
This is an online chat made with Tkinter, sockets, and threading. This will be a normal chat with your friends on the server but in the background, each message will be given a sentiment value. If the value is on a varying level of negativity, a warning will be shown, preventing cyber bullying. Also, at the end of the chat the user can decide to see a graph of how their sentiment in their messages changed over the chat. By Henry Boisdequin (1 month and 1 week into coding)

To Chat:
- Server is for local wifi (have to play on the same wifi)
- Download all of the flies and leave the project a star
- If you have not downloaded modules like Tkinter or vader than there will be an automatic installation when the sript will be run
- If that doesn't work, go to your terminal or command promt and type - 
```pip install 'module name you don't have'```

Happy chatting!
